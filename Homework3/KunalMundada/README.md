### Issues to Solve:

#### HW2
- [X] Data Science – map, scatter plot, dendrogram (-10) The overall ratio of component sizes can be improved. 
- [X] Title and legend are too big. 
- [X] The map view is compressed on my screen. The dengrogram could use a larger space. (-2) 
- The scatter plot could’ve had lines connected to provide some continuity. 
- [X] The current design on the map is also hard to tell which end refers to the employee, which end refers to the company. Tooltip could help resolve this issue.

#### HW3
- Legend in the scatter plot and sunburst is missing. (-1) 
- Colors are overused. The color scale for the salary is good (although the color differences can be bigger). But colors in other views should be changed. 
- (1) The map view could’ve taken up the rest of the vertical space. 
- (2) You can give more space of the scatter plot to the sun burst so that the user can still see all the information of the scatter plot while we get to see more details about the sunburst diagram. 
- (3) The colors can change more drastically (darker blue) for the salary scale. The dark-grey areas indicate no data, but the color is so dark that it draws user’s attention. Should try lighter gray. 
- (4) Can use a single hue color scale that is not blue for the company sizes. Ideally the large should have the darkest color (in the dashboard it is medium) 
- (5) The scatter plot also needs two more colors, one is the selected country, the other is the rest of the world. Recommend the former use a color for highlights, so that we can color the same in the map to indicate the country is selected. The latter can be a different gray. Gray and black are often used to represent the whole or the data missingness, since their purpose is to highlight other more salient colors.


#### Email recommendations  
- (1) Let the map view take up the whole left-side screen.
- (2) Use different colors in the scatter plot and the sunburst diagram to encode company sizes, selected country, and rest of world. Add the legend correspondingly.
