# Interaction Techniques

The interaction techniques I implemented are:

- Hovering and selection for radar chart: can be done through the polygons and the legend. Pokemon type is chosen here.
- Transferring data from radar chart to bar chart: The bar chart will change to a stacked bar chart with the selected Pokemon type as the base and the constituent body styles of that type form the stacks.
- Hovering and selection for bar chart: can be done through the bars and the legend. Pokemon body style is chosen here.
- Transferring data from bar chart to heatmap: The heatmap will highlight the cell corresponding to the selected body style and the selected Pokemon type and display the exact number of Pokemon with that combination.

Therefore, the goal of the dashboard, to help Nuzlockers choose the viability of a mono-type, mono-body style team, is achieved.
