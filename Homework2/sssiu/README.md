    <b>Pokemon Data Visualization</b>

</h1>
Pokemon data visualization is created based on Create React App and D3.js. 

I preprocessed pokemon_alopez247.csv data and stored the data in pokemon_data.json instead.

To start the website in localhost, run the following command:

```console
npm install
npm run start
```
