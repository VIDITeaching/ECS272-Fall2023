# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Music and Mental Health

This dashboard aims to display some correlations that exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of Music Therapy or simply provide interesting sights about the mind. This application was built using React and Vite.
